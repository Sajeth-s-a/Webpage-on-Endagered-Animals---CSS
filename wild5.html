   With their populations significantly reduced from their historic slaughter, walruses now struggle to stay <br>alive as their habitats are substantially impacted by global warming and the ongoing legality of trade in<br> walrus ivory. This iconic Arctic species is listed as vulnerable and faces an uncertain future. If we act <br>right now, we could give the walrus a chance to survive and thrive.<br>
   
   Conservationists across the Northern Hemisphere agree that the fate of walruses is uncertain, <br>and consider them a species of “special concern” and at risk of becoming threatened if action isn’t taken to protect walruses. Historic human harvests have significantly impacted walrus populations, their populations were severely depleted until <br>steps were taken to eliminate  commercial hunting and trade.<br> However, as we continue to push for protection of other species killed<br> for their ivory, we must remember <br> that if we do not include the walrus we leave them vulnerable to become an ivory substitute.
