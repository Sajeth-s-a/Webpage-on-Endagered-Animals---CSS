   		Rhinos are becoming increasingly rare in the wild. Historically,<br> rhinos once roamed in large numbers across much of Asia and Africa but today only a fraction<br> remain on the planet.<br> It is estimated that African rhinos are killed at an average of three every day.<br>

There are five species of rhino: <br>three Asian, the Javan, Sumatran and Indian; and two African, the Southern White and Northern<br> White One of the “Big 5” game species, rhinos are easily recognizable by their large bodies, <br>short legs and one or two dermal horns.
Because of demand for these horns as a status symbol<br>, aphrodisiac and a cure for cancer in pseudo-traditional Chinese medicine, coupled with a<br> dramatic loss of habitat, all five species of <br>rhinos are now threatened, and three of the five are critically endangered (Black, Javan and <br>Sumatran species). In fact, fewer than 50 <br>Javan rhinos and fewer than 200 Sumatran rhinos remain alive in the wild. White Rhinos are<br> the most heavily poached for the illegal horn<br> trade with more than 1,200 killed in South Africa in 2014.<br>

Recent conservation efforts have made a difference in bringing some of these<br> species back from the brink of extinction, but even the numbers of these species are a mere fraction <br>of what they were just 50 years ago.<br>

Although international trade in rhino horn has been banned – rhino horn is made of keratin,<br> the same substance as your fingernails, and <br>has no medicinal value – the demand for horn has remained high and poaching has not slowed. <br>It’s up to us to step up and do something<br> to protect these majestic animals.
