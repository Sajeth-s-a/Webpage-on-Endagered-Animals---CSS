   THE LOSS OF HIPPOS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC
Hippos face threats from human-wildlife conflict <br>and habitat encroachment, with hundreds being shot each year to keep them out of crops and away<br> from homes. They are often <br>killed for their meat under the guise of protection, and both hippo fat and their ivory canine teeth<br> are considered valuable. As bans on elephant ivory continue to gain support thanks to the tireless work <br>of conservationists, buyers are looking for substitutes.<br> Hippos have carveable canine teeth,<br> and as a result, there has been an over 530% increase in hippo teeth export annually. Hippo populations<br> have also been impacted in areas with ongoing civil unrest, and in places of relative stability, they find<br> themselves entangled in snares. In the DRC, a historic hippo habitat, populations have declined by 95%.<br><br>

These amphibious mammals require access to permanent water to keep their special hides moist.<br> Common hippos live in groups of tens to hundreds, and the disappearance of a multi-ton grazer<br> from the habitat will result in dramatic ecological impacts. Very little is known about the shy pygmy hippo,<br> and while common hippos are listed as vulnerable<br> and pygmy hippos endangered, both of their conservation statuses are based on a 2004 estimate<br> recommendation.<br> Based on trends, it is likely their populations continue to decline.<br>

Hippos are an incredible, ancient creature and they must be protected.<br>
